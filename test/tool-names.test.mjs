/**
 * The 1.0 names, held where prose can drift back to the 40.
 *
 * test/skills.test.mjs and test/distribution.test.mjs already refuse a retired
 * name written in backticks or called; both read a hand-kept list and a
 * hand-kept set of files. This reads the whole shipped surface for the bare
 * word too ("use get_contact" carries no backticks), takes the retired list
 * from the CHANGELOG's own migration table so a row added there is guarded
 * without a second edit, and covers the files those two do not name.
 *
 * The CHANGELOG is the one place a retired name belongs — it is the migration
 * record — so it is the table's source here and never a scanned file.
