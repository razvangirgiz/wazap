/**
 * find_contact (F2-3): who the user means by "mama", "Ana de la contabilitate"
 * or "fotbal", as an assistant should be told before it drafts anything.
 *
 * The scoring is db.contacts.find's (src/db/contacts.ts). This module is the
 * tool around it:
 * - one account, or every linked account when the call names none: each
 *   candidate is labelled with its account, and the answer is `resolved` only
 *   when exactly one account resolved and no other had a candidate at all;
 * - a qualifier that is only digits (4 or more) keeps the candidates whose
 *   number ends with them, so two people saved under one name can still be
 *   told apart once the user says which;
 * - `resolved` carries the full chat_id and, when the session can write, the
 *   draft context (src/draft-style.ts): the recent exchange and the user's
 *   style there. Not for a `#private` contact (style only), not when the
 *   account turned it off (`draft_context: false` in accounts.json, `wazap
 *   config draft-context off`), not when the caller passes include_context:
 *   false;
 * - `ambiguous` and `not_found` never carry a message's words, and a
 *   candidate's number only as its last four digits: the assistant has to ask
 *   the user and look the one they name up again, it cannot send to a guess.
 *   One name on several accounts, one candidate on each, is the exception the
 *   `fix` names: what the request is about usually says which account it
 *   means, so each candidate says since when it is `waiting` on an answer and
 *   the assistant is told to look before it asks. Nothing goes out on a guess
 *   either way: a draft's preview names the recipient, the number and the
 *   account, and the user says yes to that.
