/**
 * One account's side of catch_up (F2-2): what the user missed, read off the
 * account database in a window of message ids, as unbudgeted entries per
 * section. src/catchup.ts merges accounts, spends the token budget, renders
 * and pages; the service supplies names and the network-free lookups
 * (`CatchupHost`), so this runs against a bare AccountDb as well (the bench).
 *
 * The window (see resolveWindow):
 * - "last" reads what reached the account after the client's mark — by
 *   stored_seq, the order messages were stored in, so a message filed late (a
 *   call when it ends, dated at its ring; a retried decryption; one dated
 *   ahead) is in the next catch-up, not under the mark — and moves the mark
 *   once the whole digest was given; a first run, or a mark more than 7 days
 *   old, reads the last 24 h;
 * - "previous" repeats the window the last complete digest covered;
 * - "hours" and an ISO "since" are explicit windows by time and never move the mark.
 * Nothing sent more than 14 days ago is in any window.
 *
 * Inside it, each chat starts later still: after the user's own last word
 * there and after the newest message the phone reported read (what "missed"
 * means). Nothing reads a message above the window's tops, the id and the
 * stored_seq fixed when the digest started, so the digest is what the account
 * held at that instant; its later pages are served from it (src/catchup.ts).
 *
 * `waiting` is not bound by the window: an ask stays until the user answers,
 * marks it handled, or it is 14 days old, as get_unanswered has it.
