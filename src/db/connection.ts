 * `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` — the write lock the migration uses — and holding it across
 * the version read and the copy. So:
 *
 * - no other process can commit a migration while the copy is being taken, so
 *   the copy is never of a database halfway through its upgrade and never of
 *   one already upgraded under an older version's name;
 * - the version the copy is named for is read under that lock, not before it,
 *   so a process that lost the race finds the schema current and copies nothing;
 * - the copy is read off the open connection, which is not in a transaction, so
 *   it is the last committed state — a writer's uncommitted pages are invisible
 *   to it (WAL) and its read lock does not block one;
 * - a database another process is migrating right now fails to take the lock and
 *   fails exactly where the migration would have, with the same error.
 *
 * The lock is released before the journal-mode switch (a pragma no transaction
 * may hold) and taken again by `migrate()`, which re-reads the version inside
 * it: whoever gets there second finds nothing left to do.
