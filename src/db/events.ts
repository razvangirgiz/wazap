/**
 * The webhook outbox as rows: what to post, in which order, and how each
 * attempt went. The dispatcher (src/webhook-outbox.ts) decides when to post
 * and what counts as fresh; this only moves an event between states, and every
 * move names the state it expects, so a stale writer changes nothing.
 *
 *   pending ──claim──▶ sending ──delivered──▶ delivered
 *      ▲                  │──fail──────────▶ failed
 *      └──────retry───────┘
 *   pending/sending ──cancel──▶ cancelled
 *
 * A `sending` row is a POST in flight, or one a crash interrupted. claim()
 * takes one over only once it is older than a POST can run, so two
 * dispatchers over one file (a service stopping while its successor starts)
 * never post one event at once; a receiver may still see an event twice after
 * a crash, but never loses one. The writes that record a POST's answer name
 * the attempt they answer, so a dispatcher that was overtaken changes nothing.
 *
 * Every event is in a lane — its chat, or the account's connection — and only
 * the oldest open event of each lane may be posted (laneHeads).
