/**
 * The durable webhook outbox: one dispatcher per account, posting the events
 * the account database holds (db.events), oldest first and one at a time.
 *
 * - An event is written in the transaction that stores its message, so a
 *   message is never stored without its event, nor an event without its
 *   message. Only the server process posts; status and doctor read the same
 *   rows read-only (readWebhookDelivery).
 * - The body of a message event is built when it is posted, from the message
 *   as it is then: an edit or a transcript that landed meanwhile goes out with
 *   it, and a message deleted, expired or cleared first is not posted at all.
 * - Order is per chat: an event is posted only once every older event of its
 *   chat is delivered, failed or cancelled, and connection events keep their
 *   own order. An event waiting for its transcript or its next retry holds
 *   back its own chat, never another. Still one POST at a time per account.
 * - A connection event with a newer one behind it is cancelled unposted: after
 *   an outage the receiver hears the current status, not every flap.
 * - Retries: a timeout, an unreachable host, 408, 425, 429 or 5xx is tried
 *   again after 1 s, 5 s, 30 s and 2 min, then every 5 min, and one last time
 *   24 h after the event was created; then it has failed. Any other 4xx fails
 *   at once. New traffic brings a waiting retry forward: an event queued, or a
 *   POST that succeeded, retries at once every event whose last attempt is at
 *   least 30 s old, so a receiver that came back hears everything within a
 *   POST or two instead of at its next slot.
 * - At least once: a POST is marked as started before it is sent, and a crash
 *   during it leaves the event to be sent again, once the claim is older than
 *   a POST can run. Receivers dedupe by message_id.
 * - Delivered events are kept 7 days, failed and cancelled ones 30.
