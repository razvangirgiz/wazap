/**
 * The `#private` tag: someone the user keeps out of what an assistant is
 * handed without asking. Their words — a message's text, caption, transcript,
 * quote, a link's or a file's preview, a poll's text — reach the assistant only
 * when the call names them: their chat (`chat_id`), a message of theirs
 * (`message_id`, get_message and get_media) or them as the author (search's
 * `from`). A group named by `chat_id` reads whole. Everywhere else the words
 * stay out and the metadata stays in: who, when, in which chat, what kind, how
 * many.
 *
 * - catch_up counts them without quoting (src/catchup-scan.ts);
 * - find_contact's draft context keeps only the user's style for them;
 * - search without `chat_id` leaves their messages out before its limit and
 *   counts them in `private_omitted`, and a quote of theirs loses its words;
 * - wait_for_messages, unless it waits on their chat, keeps what arrived from
 *   them without its words (withoutWords), marked `private`;
 * - list_chats keeps the last message of their chat, or theirs in a group,
 *   without its words, marked `private`;
 * - read_messages on "status" keeps their stories without text, caption or
 *   preview, marked `private`: a story is never asked for by name.
 *
 * The tag goes with the person, not only their chat: what they write in a
 * group is theirs too. A broad read takes the whole set once per call and per
 * account (privatePeople), and with several accounts a person tagged on any of
 * them is tagged on all: the accounts pass each other the jids (taggedJids,
 * the tools' privateRule). The webhook is the builder's channel, not the
 * assistant's, and is not touched.
 *
 * Tags are stored normalized (lowercase, without "#"), so the tag a user files
 * as "#private" or "Private" is `private`. Groups carry no tags.
