/**
 * WhatsApp service over Baileys. Baileys emits raw events rather than exposing
 * a queryable store, so this files what they carry in the account database
 * (`accounts/<id>/wazap.sqlite`, see src/db) and answers the tools from it.
 * What stays in memory is bounded by people and chats, never by messages: the
 * lid pairings, group metadata, the last arrivals a wait can replay, drafts.
 *
 * This class owns the socket and the connection's state (status, account,
 * generation, sync), the lifecycle (start, pairing, reconnect, stop) and the
 * event wiring, and is the WhatsAppApi every caller uses. What it does lives
 * in parts under src/service/, one per concern, each reaching the service
 * through a small host it is lent. The state and the seams tests replace
 * (sockClient, status, account, mediaBuffer, transcriber, drafts, writes, readMarks,
 * webhook, healContacts, saveCreds) stay here.
