/**
 * The link's own watch, as opposed to the account's (src/service/health.ts): how long the link
 * has been down, whether the owner was told, and a watchdog for what Baileys' own keepalive does
 * not catch. Part of WhatsAppService (src/whatsapp.ts), which tells it every status change and
 * lends it the socket through LinkHost. Only the server runs it: a short-lived command (status
 * --live, a resync) neither alerts nor touches the state on disk.
 *
 * - The outage clock starts at the first status that is not `connected` while the account has a
 *   session, and stops at `connected`. It is kept in `link.json` beside the account's database,
 *   so the exit that hands a long outage to the supervisor does not restart it, nor tell it twice.
 *   A clean stop forgets an outage nobody was told about; the next start counts from itself.
 * - Alerts, posted as the webhook's `alert` event and logged on stderr: `disconnected` once the
 *   link has been down without a break for the threshold (WAZAP_ALERT_AFTER, ALERT_AFTER_MS when
 *   unset), so drops that reconnect inside it are never told, `recovered` when it comes back after one, and
 *   `relink_required` at once when WhatsApp unlinked the device or the credentials are corrupt.
 *   Each at most once per outage, across restarts.
 * - The watchdog ticks every WATCH_TICK_MS. A tick later than WAKE_GAP_MS past its time means the
 *   machine slept (or the process was frozen): a socket that looks connected is pinged, one that
 *   was still connecting is replaced, and a reconnect waiting out its backoff runs now. Asleep is
 *   not down, so an outage the owner was not told about moves its clock forward by the sleep.
 *   Between wakes, a connected socket is pinged every PROBE_EVERY_MS and replaced after
 *   PROBE_FAILURES_TO_RECONNECT unanswered pings; a socket stuck connecting for CONNECT_STUCK_MS is
 *   replaced; and a link left down with no reconnect on its way gets one.
 *
 * Nothing here deletes credentials or decides a session is gone: replacing a socket goes through
 * the same paced reconnect a dropped link does.
