/**
 * Scheduled messages and reminders, for one account: what makes them, lists
 * and cancels them, and the timer that sends or fires each when its time
 * comes. Part of WhatsAppService (src/whatsapp.ts), which lends it the
 * database, the link, the webhook and the one confirm every send passes.
 *
 * A scheduled message is a draft the user said yes to for a later time. When
 * that time comes it goes out through the same confirm as any draft, under
 * the key it was drafted with, so every guard of a send runs at that moment:
 * the account's record on disk (enabled, writes on), the server's read-only
 * switch, the send rules, the link and WhatsApp's own restrictions, and the
 * account's write rate. A refusal that no retry fixes closes it as failed; a
 * passing one (the link is down, the rate limit) waits and tries again, until
 * SCHEDULE_GRACE_MS after its time. Past that it is missed: never sent late,
 * never in a burst after a restart, and told to the webhook (`scheduled`),
 * get_status's hint and the list.
 *
 * Only a service the hub runs has a scheduler (enable): a CLI command that
 * opens the account for a moment never sends anything on its own.
