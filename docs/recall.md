# Semantic recall

With recall on, `search` matches what was meant and the words at once: a
paraphrase still hits through its meaning, a short question through its words,
and the two rankings are fused. With the default model a question in another
language than the chat seldom finds it; `WAZAP_EMBED_MODEL=bge-m3` does (see
below). A match counts on its similarity alone; age only orders.
It reaches every message the account keeps. For an exact string — an id, a
phone number, a URL — pass `match: "words"`. When meaning search cannot run —
recall off, the embedding server failing or refusing the query, or the sidecar
still starting after 2.5 s — `search` matches the words only and says so
(`mode: "keyword_fallback"`, with `recall_unavailable` naming the cause and, for
recall off, the command that turns it on).

Cached connectors use the same search, including meaning. `match` defaults to `auto`: natural
questions use hybrid retrieval, while codes, URLs, email addresses and fully
quoted literals use exact matching without starting the embedding model.
`match: "hybrid"` and `match: "words"` remain explicit. A lexical cursor with
`auto` continues by words; an explicit hybrid cursor is refused.

By default the best five hits carry `contexts`: small chronological windows
read from the existing conversation index, at most three neighbours on each
side within 15 minutes, plus a visible direct reply target in the same chat.
Explicit date limits still apply. Context may include other authors; a broad
read still excludes private people unless the call names that author. Each
source has its own message id and timestamp, with long text marked truncated.
`include_context: false` skips these windows and their bounded coverage
reranking. Context does not add an always-on index or a cached copy of message
text; edits, retractions, expiry and private tags are read fresh. No history is
fetched from the phone to fill a window.

A window can also carry `later`: at most two newer messages of the same chat,
past the window, that share two of the hit's subject words (cut to five
letters, so "tortul" meets "torturi"; greetings and filler do not count). A
plan changed two weeks on seldom repeats the question's words, but it repeats
the plan's, so the hit and what replaced it arrive together. The same date
limits and privacy rules apply, and only the newest 200 messages after the hit
are read for it.

Long context messages use a contiguous, query-relevant excerpt; `text_offset`
locates it in the source and `text_truncated` says it is incomplete. Search
rechecks sources after identity/metadata work, and all accounts again before a
merged response. Sources deleted, changed or newly private while that work
awaited are omitted (`changed_during_read`); an account replacement or owner
change refuses the read. Automatic literal matching excludes a longer code
that merely shares the query's prefix; explicit `match: "words"` retains
substring matching and lexical cursor semantics.
Post-filtering stops after 2,000 candidates and reports capped coverage, so a
large run of rejected prefixes or private hits cannot trigger an exhaustive
history scan. Narrow the chat/date or refine the query when that happens.

`assessment` distinguishes candidates, underspecified questions matching
several chats, and no matches in the searched history. It is not a calibrated
confidence score: the assistant must check corrections in context and cite
the actual supporting source, or ask one short clarification when necessary.
The existing meaning-only similarity floors still apply before contextual
reranking. A result does not establish absence from unsynced history.

Repeated and simultaneous identical questions reuse their account's bounded
query-vector cache; a query that finishes after the time budget warms a later
attempt. Search results and message text are never cached by that mechanism.

## Evaluation

`npm run bench:search` runs the fictional cases in `eval/search-questions.json`
against a deterministic embedding stub. Use `-- --model real` for the already
installed local model, `--runs 10 --json report.json` for timings and
`--require-pass` to require all cases. A stub checks the retrieval contract,
not real model quality. Reports distinguish a source hit from supporting
evidence in its context; these measure retrieval, not the assistant's final
answer. Timings are server-side, with uncached questions and repeated warm
queries reported separately; they are not connector or answer-generation latency.

`node scripts/bench-search.mjs --root /path/to/baseline --model real` compares
an older build. `--private-cases /path/to/cases.json --model real` uses a backup
of the default account, never its live database or WhatsApp connection. That
report contains case numbers and aggregate metrics, not queries or messages.
Freeze the input database for a before/after comparison; `--compare before.json`
fails when a formerly passing case regresses. An unavailable meaning search is
reported and cannot silently count as a successful negative.

`--compact-query` and `--context-model-experiment` are offline ablations, not
runtime search settings. The latter evaluates query-time contextual embeddings
on the immutable copy; it does not add a production index or model request.

Off by default, and fully local: a `llama-server` sidecar bound to loopback
does the embedding, so nothing leaves the machine. It needs llama.cpp, the
pinned model and persisted history (`WAZAP_PERSIST_HISTORY`, on by default):

```bash
brew install llama.cpp      # macOS; elsewhere build llama.cpp and put llama-server on PATH
wazap embed download        # fetch the embedding model, ~318 MB sha256-verified
wazap config recall local   # then restart the service
```

`wazap embed download` offers the `brew install` itself when `llama-server`
is missing. `wazap status` runs the three checks — `recall`, `llama-server`,
`embed model` — and `get_status` reports the index as `off`, `indexing`,
`ready` or `degraded`.

`chat_id`, `since`, `until` and `from` narrow a search by meaning exactly as
they narrow one by words. Hits rank by a fused score (reciprocal rank fusion of the
word and meaning rankings), and a hit found only by meaning must clear the
similarity floor, so a question with no answer comes back empty. With bge-m3 a
hit that carries no word of the query needs 0.62 rather than the 0.55 floor;
setting `WAZAP_RECALL_MIN_SIMILARITY` sets both. A match found
by meaning weighs a little less with age — 85% a month on, never under 70%, for
its rank and for the floor — so the fresher of two close matches comes first
while a clearly closer old one still does, and a word hit whose meaning falls
under the floor ranks by its words alone. One chat takes at most three leading
places before other chats' hits, and a near-duplicate trails the list. The vectors
live in the account database next to their messages, are made in the
background for every message that has none, and leave with their message when
it is deleted, revoked or expires; an edit makes its vector again. A message
wazap holds only as text — carried over from the recall index an older wazap
built — is marked `from_index`: `get_message` returns its text, but
`get_media` has nothing to open and it cannot be replied to or forwarded.

Embedding requests refuse redirects, cap replies at 4 MiB and validate vector
shape and finite values. Provider bodies and decoder stderr are not copied into
errors.

`wazap config recall local|off` sets `WAZAP_RECALL`, and every kept message is
indexed. The model is embeddinggemma-300m (~318 MB). For a history written in
more than one language, set `WAZAP_EMBED_MODEL=bge-m3` in the data dir's `.env`
and run `wazap embed download --model bge-m3` (~635 MB): it finds an answer
asked in another language (an English question for a Romanian message) where
gemma does not, at twice the size and embed time. Changing the model indexes
everything again in the background; until it is done, meaning reaches only the
messages indexed so far.
