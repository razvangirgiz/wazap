# Contributor notes

wazap is the `wazap-mcp` npm package; the command it installs is `wazap`. This
file is for people changing the code. `AGENT.md` (singular) is a different
document — it ships in the package and drives a first-time setup for an agent's
user.

## Layout

- `src/*.ts` — all runtime code, ESM, TypeScript strict. `npm run build` emits
  `dist/`; `dist/` is gitignored and is what actually runs.
- `test/*.test.mjs` — plain JS tests on `node:test`. They import the **built**
  `dist/` and spawn `dist/index.js` against throwaway data dirs, so a source
  edit is not tested until `npm run build` runs. `npm test` builds first.
  `test/helpers.mjs` has the shared plumbing (`childEnv` scrubs `WAZAP_*` so a
  developer shell cannot leak into a child).
- `scripts/*.mjs` — repo utilities (bundle, icon, badges), also plain JS.
- `dist-bundle/`, `node_modules/` — generated, never edit, never lint.

## Commands

- `npm run build` — `tsc` to `dist/`.
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`.
- `npm test` — builds, then runs the suite.
- `npm run lint` — ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) over `src/`,
  `test/`, `scripts/`; Prettier-compatible via `eslint-config-prettier`.
- `npm run check` — the local gate: lint → typecheck → test (which builds).
  Green from a clean tree before you push.
- `npm run check:clock` — runs the whole suite on three clocks that break day
  arithmetic (a local midnight, a new year's eve a day ahead of UTC, an hour a
  zone repeats) and once on the real one to tell a pre-existing red from a
  clock-bound one, then names any test that fails only on a moved clock;
  `npm run sweep:clock` walks the full zone × moment matrix. About three
  minutes, so it is not in `check`.
- `npm run hooks:install` — installs the pre-push hook; once per clone.
- `npm run bench:db` — builds, then times the account database (`src/db/`) on
  synthetic data: 100k messages, vector and hybrid search at 13k and 100k.
  `--messages 1000000 --vectors 1000000` is the local 1M run; `--check` fails on
  generous budgets. Not part of the gate.
- `npm run fold:table` — regenerates `src/db/fold-table.ts` from the bundled
  SQLite when a test says the trigram index folds differently.
- `node scripts/import-legacy.mjs --data-dir <copy>` — after `npm run build`,
  imports one account's legacy files (`store.json`,
  `history/`, `retention.json`, `notes.json`, `recall/`, the beta
  `archive.sqlite`) into a separate account database beside the data dir and
  verifies it against the legacy service's view. Point it at a copy, never the
  live data dir. Prints counts and keys only, numbers masked. Not part of the gate.

## The gate and the hook

`npm run check` covers what CI runs on each Node (`npm ci`, then lint,
typecheck and `npm test`, on Node 22 and 24). The one CI step you cannot run in
place is `npm ci`, because it wipes `node_modules`; `check` assumes a working
install and CI proves the clean-install path. CI also runs
`npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` as its own job, and a weekly
`Baileys canary` workflow runs typecheck and the suite against the newest
Baileys on npm; a red canary blocks nothing, it says the pin has a problem
coming.

A pre-push hook (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`) runs the fast part of the gate:
lint, typecheck, test. `npm run hooks:install` points `core.hooksPath` at that
directory — run it once per clone.

Skip it consciously when you must: `git push --no-verify` or
`SKIP_GATE=1 git push`. Skipping to move faster on a broken tree just moves the
red to CI.

Recall quality has its own check: `node scripts/recall-eval.mjs <cases.json>`
scores a fixed case set against the running daemon, so prompt, model and
floor changes are measured, not eyeballed. The real cases are private data
and are not committed; `scripts/recall-eval.example.json` shows the shape.

How well assistants use the tools has its own harness, `scripts/eval/`. An
evaluation server (`scripts/eval/server.mjs`) serves the real MCP endpoint over
a fictional two-account world (`eval/fixtures/world.json`) on fake sockets: it
refuses `~/.wazap` and the live ports, can never open WhatsApp, and records a
trace of every tool call and every write that would have reached WhatsApp. The
cases (`eval/cases/*.json`) assert on capabilities, which `eval/tool-map/`
maps to tool names per version; `only_when` narrows a tool that serves several
(a 1.0 `get_media` call is `transcribe` only when it transcribed or named a
voice note or audio; a `find_contact` call is `read_context` only when it
brought recent messages, and a case accepting it names the message those must
hold through `seen`).

- `node scripts/eval/run-claude.mjs --cases baseline-0.23 --model sonnet` runs
  headless Claude Code, isolated to the evaluation server, and scores the run.
  Transcripts go to `~/.wazap-eval/runs/`; `--save
  eval/results/<version>/<date>-<model>-<mode>.summary.json` keeps the summary.
  Costs real subscription usage: `--max-budget-usd` per attempt, `--stop-at-usd`
  for the run. Never Fable.
- `node scripts/eval/score.mjs <run-dir> [--compare <summary.json>] [--judge]`
  rescores a run on the 1.0 map; a run recorded against 0.23.x takes
  `--tool-map 0.23`. The LLM judge is off by default and informative only.
- `eval/chatgpt-protocol.md` with `scripts/eval/manual.mjs` is the manual
  ChatGPT arm.

`test/eval-harness.test.mjs` keeps the harness in the gate without a model: a
scripted oracle passes representative cases and an agent that does nothing
fails them. The sandbox socket it shares with the server is `test/sandbox.mjs`.

## Commit style

`<Area>: <what changed>` as a sentence, from `git log`:
`Webhook: make message_sent and connection opt-in`, `Docs: the new webhook
events are opt-in`, `CI: test on every PR`. Releases are `Release X.Y.Z:`.
Small commits per logical step.

## Releases

A release is one commit and one tag; CI does the publishing.

1. Bump the version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (both root
   entries), `server.json` (top level and the npm package), `manifest.json`
   and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
   `test/distribution.test.mjs` fails when `server.json` or `manifest.json`
   drift from `package.json`.
2. Add a `## X.Y.Z` section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`. It becomes the
   GitHub Release notes, and publishing refuses a version without one.
3. Commit as `Release X.Y.Z: <what is in it>`, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push the commit
   and the tag.

The tag runs `.github/workflows/publish.yml`. The `publish` job checks the tag
against `package.json` and the CHANGELOG section, lints, typechecks, runs
`npm publish --provenance` (whose `prepublishOnly` builds and tests), waits
for the version on npm and publishes `server.json` to the MCP Registry through
GitHub OIDC. The `release` job then builds `wazap-X.Y.Z.mcpb` and creates the
GitHub Release with it attached. Run by hand, the workflow refuses anything
but a tag.

When a step fails after `npm publish`, do not re-run the whole workflow: npm
refuses the same version twice. `scripts/release-registry.sh` is the manual
fallback for the registry step. A failed `release` job alone can be re-run
from the Actions page, since that re-runs only the failed job.

## Rules that must never break

- **stdout is the MCP protocol.** In `serve` over stdio, every byte on stdout
  is protocol. Human-readable lines go to stderr (see `src/logger.ts`). A
  stray `console.log` corrupts sessions silently.
- **One process owns a data dir.** `server.lock` in the data dir enforces it;
  two servers on one dir must refuse to start, never share.
- **No secrets, ever.** `.env`, `accounts.json`, tokens and pairing codes stay
  out of the tree.
- **Settings are few on purpose.** `.env.example` and the README's Settings
  table list every `WAZAP_*` a user sets, and nothing else. A new user-facing
  setting needs a reason and goes there; a knob only tests need goes under
  Development knobs below. A setting that stops being read goes into
  `RETIRED_SETTINGS` in `src/config.ts`, so whoever still sets it gets a warning
  naming its replacement instead of a silent change. One still honoured until
  the next major version goes into `DEPRECATED_SETTINGS` instead
  (`WAZAP_TRANSPORT` until 2.0).
- **Secrets in errors are redacted.** The webhook secret and tokens never
  appear in error strings or logs; keep it that way.
- **A schema migration never runs without a copy of the file beside it.**
  `Connection.open` copies an older account database to
  `wazap.<old version>.pre-migration.sqlite` before it writes anything, under
  the write lock the migration itself takes, and refuses to migrate when the
  copy cannot be written (`BACKUP_FAILED`). Only `WAZAP_PRE_MIGRATION_BACKUP=0`
  skips it. A new migration therefore needs no rescue path of its own, and
  nothing may move a write ahead of that copy.
- **Hygiene is not behavior.** Lint, format and docs commits must not change
  what the binary does.

## Development knobs

Still read, deliberately left out of the README and `.env.example`: tests and
local debugging use them, users should not need them. Do not document them as
settings; do not remove one while a test sets it.

- `WAZAP_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` — `status` and doctor skip the npm registry call.
  `test/helpers.mjs` sets it for every child.
- `WAZAP_NO_SHARE=1` — no loopback endpoint and no `daemon.json`, so a second
  wazap on the data dir is refused instead of bridging. The daemon, control and
  bridge tests, and `test/calfa-contract.test.mjs`, rely on it.
- `WAZAP_LIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` — how long a live probe (`status --live`, setup's
  check, `contacts resync`) waits for WhatsApp; 15 s by default.
- `WAZAP_TRANSCRIBE_AUTO=0` — keeps `get_media`'s transcripts, stops background
  transcription of incoming notes.
- `WAZAP_TRANSCRIBE_URL`, `WAZAP_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL` — another OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint and its model; the tests point the URL at a local stub.
  `wazap config transcribe openai` still asks for the URL at a terminal.
- `WAZAP_WHISPER_MODEL` (`turbo`, `large-v3`, `medium`), `WAZAP_WHISPER_BIN` —
  the whisper.cpp model and binary.
- `WAZAP_EMBED_MODEL` (`embeddinggemma-300m`, `e5-base-multilingual`),
  `WAZAP_EMBED_BIN` — the embedding model and `llama-server` binary.
- `WAZAP_RECALL_MIN_SIMILARITY` — the recall floor, 0..1; tests set `0` to see
  every hit.
- `WAZAP_EMBED_URL` — an already-running embedding server instead of the
  sidecar; the recall tests' stub. Whatever it points at receives message and
  query text, so never aim it at another machine you do not trust.

## Lint ignores, and why

- `dist/`, `dist-bundle/`, `node_modules/` — generated output.
- `*.test.mjs` and `scripts/*.mjs` are linted as plain JS: they intentionally
  do not go through the TypeScript rules, since `tsc` does not check them.
